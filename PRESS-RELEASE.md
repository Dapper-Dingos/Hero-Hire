## An outreach hub powered by volunteerism. ##
  
## Problem ##
  In this digital age, people often forget the trials their neighbors endure on a daily basis.  Despite the ability to communicate with an endless online population, tangible problems - large and small - still arise throughout life.  There is no centralized location to ask for - and receive - help when it is really needed, which hurts communities worldwide.  The elderly, alone, and disabled often have little available options when completing tasks such as shopping for groceries, raking leaves, and other jobs.  They need help; we all sometimes do.

## Solution ##
  HeroHire sets out to ease the life of the needy through a powerful volunteer based communal network that encourages helping  neighbors.  Once logged in, users can post jobs that they need completed through a clean, simple interface.  Authenticated users can volunteer through each posting, cultivating a powerful local support system. 

## Quote from You ##
  "We have found that despite options such as Google, Craigslist, Facebook, and countless other social networks being available, there was no easy way to ask for someone to simply ask for help.  As we have moved further into an always-on, always-connected era, personal communication has become inversely absent, resulting in further isolation between people living within the same neighborhoods, towns, and cities.  HeroHire helps remove these boundaries and give users a safe, effective set of tools to ask for and receive help.  It also rewards those who continually demonstrate their sincerety, encouraging a social network to be extended into the tangible world."

## How to Get Started ##

## Customer Quote ##

Thankfully, HeroHire gives me the chance to ask for help.  People show up with smiles on their faces and happily take care of whatever I need.  It's so nice to know that there are still people who care in this world, willing to take time out of their day to help strangers in need."
